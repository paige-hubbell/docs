# What is Overwhelming?

- lots of channels of communication

- unclear work tracking

- think time feels lacking

- too many inputs (same as channels?)

- lots of new people to bring up to speed

- lack of clarity about the role. What am I supposed to be doing?

- don't feel at all confident of team velocity vs the road map.
